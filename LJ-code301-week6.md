# Code 301 Week 6 - Deployment

This week was pretty challenging. The material was a little difficult, but the real problems were the technical difficulties. PSQL on my laptop wasn't working well with the code from our lab.

On Saturday I brought my laptop with Ubuntu, hoping this would solve the problem, but sadly it did not. In my group we also had a laptop running the Ubuntu app on Windows, and neither of these would play well with Heroku. We wasted a lot of time troubleshooting, and eventually had to recreate the database on a MacBook to get it to work. It was a tough day, and we weren't able to finish the lab.

Other than that, I think I'm understanding the material.
