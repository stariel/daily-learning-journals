**Code 201 Day 4 - 8/10/17**

Today we covered layout in CSS, which was really helpful. I feel like that is something that I really struggled with, and now I want to go back and fix my page. :)

During lab we did pair programming and I worked with Gabriel. We had a good time and I think we worked well together. The only disadvantage was that we both felt like we understand JavaScript best, so that part was easy.

We finished quickly and decided to work more on our CSS, since that's what we feel like we need to learn more of.
