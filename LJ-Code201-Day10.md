**Code 201 - Day 10 - 8/18/17**

Today in class we did code review of the cookie stand functions / table creation, then had the chance to see some of the Code 401 midterm and final presentations along with Partner Power Hour about salary negotiations.

For lab we worked with a partner (I worked with Rob) to create a website to match the chocolate pizza PDF we were given. I think the partner programming went well. Rob was "driving" and I was "navigating".
I think we did a pretty good job of replicating the page, although there were a few things we couldn't match exactly, like some of the fonts. However, we were able to use CSS to style our page to be a pretty close match to the PDF we were given. And we had a good time working together, or at least I did!
