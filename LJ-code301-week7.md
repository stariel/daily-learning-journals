# Code 301 Week 7 - SPAs and Middleware

This was a pretty packed week! Unfortunately we started out a bit behind in our book app due to technical issues with heroku last week. That made it a little more challenging. But in the end we worked well together and made a lot of progress on our book app.

I feel like this week was the hardest in terms of material of any of my time at CodeFellows so far, but I also feel like I learned a lot and in the end it was pretty successful. Not bad!
