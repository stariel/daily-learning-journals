**Code 301 - Week 2**

This week we used learned about using JQuery to set up event handlers, and using handlebars.js for templating.

I pair programmed with Rafael this week, which went well.

On Tuesday we were able to complete pretty much all of the 03-jquery-and-events lab. It was pretty straightforward, other than figuring out the nested selectors for the Read more... / Read less... We did figure it out eventually.

Thursday we worked on the 04-templating, which we didn't have much trouble with.

Today we worked on the stretch goal of using a handlebars template to populate the filter lists. Overall it seemed like it was not necessarily better than simply using JQuery. The template was very helpful for displaying the articles, but in this case it didn't seem to make much of a difference in the code.
