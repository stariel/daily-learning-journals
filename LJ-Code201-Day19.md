Code 201 - Day 19 - 8/31/17

Today we finished up our final group project for 201. We mostly worked on the README and CSS to make our site look the way we wanted it to. In the afternoon we discussed the presentation and practiced on the projector out front.

I attempted to get Google charts working on our site, but couldn't get it to do what I wanted before our edits cut-off time (decided by the group) so sadly we won't have charts. But I did learn a bit about how to use Google charts, and hopefully that will be useful in the future.
