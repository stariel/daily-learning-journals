**Code 201 - Day 18 - 8/30/17**

Today our team worked on adding functionality to our site, mostly by adding and scoring additional questions.

I added the rest of our survey questions to the form while Tiger added them to the form harvester function and Kinley and Marco added them to the buddy functions. After a bit of CSS, we all met together as a group to mob program our scoreMaker function.

We used a rotation where one member of the team wrote up the pseudocode on the board, two members navigated the code, and one member "drove". We did this all on my laptop because it has the biggest screen. (Huge laptops are good for something, at least!)

We tackled the more complex questions first and then went out for a group lunch. After lunch we finished. Then we had to deal with some troubleshooting, but by the end of the day we had our scoring function working and were ready to work on our more stretchy stretch goals.
