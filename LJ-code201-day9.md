**Code 201 - Day 9 - 8/17/17**

Today we learned more about forms and how to modify them with CSS. We also made an almost-functional calculator!

Today I really started to feel like I'm getting more comfortable with CSS. Up until this point, I have felt like I can't do what I need to do to make things look the way I want. But today I styled my Pat's Salmon Cookies public-facing site, and I think it turned out pretty well!
