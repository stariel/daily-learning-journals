Code 201 - Day 1 - 8/7/17
On Day 1 we went over administrative info for CodeFellows and a lot of the prework and reading. We also went over using git and some new things we needed for our assignment.

For our lab we had to use prompts and variables to ask questions, store answers, and respond via alerts. I worked with Marco and Shayne. I also tested Tiger's and Shannon's programs and they tested mine as well.

Overall I felt it was pretty straightforward and didn't have many problems with the assignment.
