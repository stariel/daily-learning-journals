# Code 301 Week 4 - SQL

This week we learned about node.js and how to run javascript outside a browser. We also learned about SQL and how to interact with databases. I was really excited about learning about databases and how to sort information in them, since I've been thinking of many ways it will be useful in future projects.

Learning about databases reminded me of a key tracking database I discussed at work a couple years ago, which sadly never got made.  As soon as I started reading about it, I thought about what Zack (our web developer) told me about relational databases.

This week for labs I pair programmed with Darcy. The labs this week were more about understanding concepts and didn't involve very much coding. I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of the material, and I'm excited to learn more.
