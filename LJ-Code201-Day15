**Code 201 - Day 15 - 8/25/17**

Today we did code review for yesterday's lab and went over some of what we will be doing in 301.

For lab, we worked with our groups on an exercise about merge conflicts and what happens when you have multiple working on the same repo and not communicating. Hint: it's bad. The most confusing part was remembering which of the fictional people we were supposed to be!

After that my group had a meeting where we did some planning and discussed tasks each of us wants to accomplish over the weekend. (Besides clearing up any lingering resubmits and doing the final test.) I'll be collecting questions for the survey we want to send out and making a Google Form.
