**Code 201 - Day 14 - 8/24/17**

Today in class we went over CSS animations which ranged from cool to headache-inducing. ;) I also really enjoyed some of the more advanced array and string methods, which I am definitely going to use for our group project!

For lab we did pair programming, and I worked with Tiger again. We worked a few different ways. First Tiger worked setting up the repo and adding pictures. Then he worked on the HTML pages while I worked on the JavaScript. After we got a little bit done, we did some driver / navigator programming to work together on some parts, and then split up some remaining tasks and worked on our own for a bit.
Overall it went well, although we did have a couple merge conflicts from not pulling down the merged code to our branches, but we managed to resolve them without too much trouble.
I had to leave at 6 to attend a coding meetup, so Tiger worked a bit more on the HTML form and styling, and I'm finishing up the delete function of the button at home.
