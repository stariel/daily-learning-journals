**Day 7 - Code 201 - 8/15/17**

Today in class we talked about HTML tables and the object constructor function. But first we had a pretty extensive code review in which I improved some of my code from yesterday.

Our lab was to rework yesterday's code to create a table of data rather than a list, and add some new information. I didn't have too hard of a time getting my data into table form. In fact, first I wrote a ginormous function which created the table, created the headings, and wrote all of each store's data to the table. It used nested for loops and actually worked! But then I read the instructions more carefully and realized I was actually supposed to use separate functions, so I fixed it. *Note to self - read instructions carefully the first time!*

Luckily for me, I got to use nested for loops in the function I created to make my totals for all stores by hours, so my earlier experiment wasn't a total waste.
