**Code 201 - Day 12 - 8/22/17**

Today we went over the code project from yesterday. We also learned about the canvas tag and how to use the chartsjs library to create charts to display our data.

I was having problems with repeats in my photo randomizing function. But other than that, I think this project is going well. I can see that having a library to make charts will make data visualization much easier!

We also had a panel about the different 401 classes. I think it actually made me more unsure than I was before! But I have a plan to try out some different things and see what I think.
