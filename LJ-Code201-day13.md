**Code 201 - Day 13 - 8/23/17**

Today I learned about data persistence and how to store data in the browser.

I created arrays from my data and pulled them out to re-populate the object properties to add subsequent votes.

I worked with Tiger on pair programming, which went well. We worked out some of our other code problems in addition to the data persistence.
