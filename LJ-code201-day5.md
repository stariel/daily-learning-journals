**Code 201 Day 5 - 8/11/17**

Today in class we went over quite a bit of information about styling text and backgrounds etc. I feel like I now have the information to make my About Me page look a lot more like my beautiful vision of it. ;)

The first part of the lab was to write some JavaScript functions to do predetermined calculations, and test them using the provided tests.js file. Before I started working, I set a time for a Pokemon break with Cody. I finshed the first four questions before the appointed time, and then Cody and I went on a 20 minute walk. I didn't find any cool Pokemon, but I did think of a quicker way to do function 3. Brains are weird.

So I came back, did Problem 5, made my DRYer version of Problem 3, and then did the stretch goals. Now to jump into the world of CSS again...
