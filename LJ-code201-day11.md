**Day 11 - Code 201 - 8/21/17**

Today I was out of town, but I watched the lecture on YouTube and got started on my Bus Mall project.

I learned that planning out code before starting helps me to see what all the steps are, and to think of certain aspects and create them from the start - not after they become a problem.

I also learned that it is hard to do homework on a train with no internet. ;)
