**Code 201 Day 3 - 8/9/17**
Today in class we covered lists, decisions and Loops, and boxes.

Our lab today was to add more questions to our About Me - one with a number and one with multiple correct answers in an array.

I'm starting to realize that the JavaScript section is generally easier for me. I figured out how to do my questions, score them, and have responses that display for the correct conditions. No sweat!

The rest of the time I tried messing with my CSS to "creatively and tastefully style" my About Me page. This is way more difficult for me, since it's hard for me to figure out why commands do what they do. It seems less logical. But I just poked around and tried different things until it looked sort of how I wanted it to.

Now I'm trying to decide whether to create yet another *experimental* branch to try to make my code more DRY. I think I know how to do it.
