**Day 6 - Code 201**

Today we talked about the DOM and how to use JavaScript to temporarily add / change the content of websites as displayed in the browser.

I was able to get my JavaScript working fairly well. It was challenging, but I figured it out. I learned to double and triple check the exact syntax of all my methods, which made it work a lot better!

After finishing I helped some other students, most notably Tiger and Michelle.
