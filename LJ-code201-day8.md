**Code 201 - Day 8 - 8/16/17**

Today we learned about forms and how to gather user information from them.

The lab involved creating a form to allow Pat to add new cookie stores to his table. I did this by taking user input from the form and putting it through the constructor function, which worked well eventually. I had a bit of a problem getting the user input to go into the constructor function correctly, but eventually with parseInt I made it happen.

After that I helped Michelle with her work from Day 7, getting the table to display and putting sales data into it.

I'd like to make my form a bit more pretty, so I'm going to have to investigate some CSS to do that.
