**Code 201 - Day 20 - 9/1/17**

Today was the day we presented our final project!

Our group met in the morning and did a bit of CSS to make our site look better on more screens by using %s for the size and positioning of the central box. After that we took a break, then got back together to practice our presentation.

I went to Partner Power Hour about APIs, which was very interesting. And after that were our presentations. I was really impressed with the projects all of the groups in our class did.
