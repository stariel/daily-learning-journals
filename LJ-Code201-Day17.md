**Code 201 - Day 17 - 8/29/17**

Today was the second day of project week. We met in the morning to discuss our plans for the day, and started working on our plan for today. Our top goals were building out our final required features - sorting the scores and isolating the top matches and displaying results on the page.

I started by pseudocoding with Tiger for the display function. He had to leave for an appointment, so I worked on adding some questions to the form.

After Tiger returned, we got both the match ranking and match display functions working, as well as adding pictures to the matches. We deployed our page, had a group meeting about how to score different questions, and assigned ourselves homework for tonight. Then Tiger and I went to the Ratio event, which was really interesting.
