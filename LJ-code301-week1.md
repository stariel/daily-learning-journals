**Code 301 - Week 1**

This week we went over the basics of JQuery, got an overview of the class schedule, and started our Code Wars challenges as well as our lab that will be ongoing. I worked with Mitch on the pair programming labs.

So far I feel like the class is going well, although it's a little different getting used to the schedule / pacing, which is quite a bit different than when I was in daytime 201.

I'm a bit concerned about how busy I'll be for the next couple of months with work and class, but so far it's ok. I even made time to see some friends this weekend, which was nice.
