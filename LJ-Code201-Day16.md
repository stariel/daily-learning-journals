**Code 201 - Day 16 - 8/28/17**

Today was the first day of project week. We did quite a bit of planning in the morning and got some good guidelines for workflow down as well as planning out some of the visuals for our project.

After our stand up we had lunch, then had a quick talk about the problem domain. Then we all started working on different parts of the project. I picked a font for our headers and did some simple CSS, then started creating some of the Buddy objects after Tiger and Kinley finished the constructor. Marco and I teamed up to get the basics of the scoring function working.

As of tonight we have a form which saves data to local storage, a function to create Buddy objects, a function to pull user input out of local storage and turn it into a Buddy, and a simple scoring function. We also have the beginnings of our layout.

Tomorrow our first task is to write the function to get the matched buddies into the DOM. Then we'll have all of the basic functionality down and can work on building it out with more questions / responses.
