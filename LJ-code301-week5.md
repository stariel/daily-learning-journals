# Learning Journal Week 5

This week was a bit weird due to the holidays, so our schedule was off. However the material - database normalization and using multiple tables, as well as how to join tables. I worked with Darcy on Wednesday and Trevor on Saturday.
We also learned about how to do all the CRUD steps, which is very useful.
I also figured out that psql is somehow weird on my computer and that was annoying.
